# Prostate-Cancer-Study

# Introduction
This repository contains the notes and code for the multi-ethnic transcriptome-wide association study of prostate cancer.  Results of this study were presented at the 69th Annual Meeting of the American Society of Human Genetics in Houston, TX. [133/9:15 Transcriptome-wide association study in African Americans identifies associations with prostate cancer. P.N. Fiorica, M. Abdul Sami, J.D. Morris, H.E. Wheeler.](http://www.ashg.org/2019meeting/listing/NumberedSessions.shtml#sess46)

# Data Acquisition
Initial genotypes and phenotypes were downloaded from the NCBI Database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP): Accession number  [phs000306.v4.p1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000306.v4.p1)

# Repository Organization
## AA_Prostate_Cancer
Information in this folder was compiled by Peter Fiorica starting in the Summer of 2019.  This folder is actively being edited and contains markdown documents for the the quality control, imputation, and association studies of the genotype and transcriptome data.  Notes and command line executions are included as they are completed.  All necessary scripts will be posted at the completion of the project.

## JA_Prostate_Cancer
This folder contains notes and scripts compiled by Peter Fiorica Starting in September 2019. The folder is actively being edited.  These notes and scripts are used for our study of prostate cancer in a self-identified Japanese American population.  The folder contains R markdown documents in their `.rmd` version and their knitted `.html` version.  These notes provide an overview of quality control, imputation, and association studies of the genotype and transcriptome data. Notes and command line executions are included as they are completed.  All necessary scripts will be posted at the completion of the project.

## LA_Prostate_Cancer
This folder contains notes and scripts compiled by Peter Fiorica Starting in September 2019. The folder is actively being edited.  These notes and scripts are used for our study of prostate cancer in a self-identified Latin American population.  The folder contains R markdown documents in their `.rmd` version and their knitted `.html` version.  These notes provide an overview of quality control, imputation, and association studies of the genotype and transcriptome data. Notes and command line executions are included as they are completed.  All necessary scripts will be posted at the completion of the project.


## Pre-Summer 2019
Information in this folder was compiled by Jack Morris and Mohammed Abdul Sami from 2017 to Spring 2019.  The notes for this information are organized as follows: 

1-12 are PRE-SUMMER 2018

13+ is POST-SUMMER 2018
