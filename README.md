# Prostate-Cancer-Study
# Predicting risk alleles for prostate cancer in multiple populations


Introduction

Most studies focus on populations of European ancestry. While genomic research has broadened knowledge on human genetics, work is needed to expand this knowledge to more diverse groups, otherwise an entire breadth of useful information is missing.

Objective

We are working to expand genetic predictors of gene expression in additional world populations using SNP data alongside gene expression levels from the third phase of the International HapMap Project.

Populations include East African, West African, East Asian, and Mexican ancestry.
Elastic net modeling is used to select genotypes and weights to best predict expression of each gene using the glmnet package for R.
