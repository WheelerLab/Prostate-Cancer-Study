Objectives: 
--Check difference between MEC vs non-MEC phenotype files
--Convert/combine MEC and non-MEC phenotype files


African American Phenotype files:

Line counts: (In order as above)
MEC: 818 + 1377 + 20 = 2215 lines
Non-MEC: 57 + 2127 + 642 = 2826 lines

Looking back at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000306.v4.p1
-  MEC stands for Multiethnic cohort study
-  From the page, "The Multiethnic Cohort (MEC) is a prospective study designed to investigate the association of diet, 
  lifestyle, and genetic factors with the incidence of cancer and other chronic diseases. In 1993-1996, more than 215,000 men 
  and women (aged 45 to 75 years at recruitment) entered the cohort by completing a 26-page mailed questionnaire that contained 
  a quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) and information on demographic factors, personal behaviors, prior medical 
  conditions, use of medications, family history of common cancers, and for women, reproductive history and use of hormone 
  therapy. Participants are mainly from five self-reported racial/ethnic populations living in Hawaii and California: African 
  Americans, Native Hawaiians, Japanese Americans, Latinos, and Whites. Incident cases of cancer are identified by annual 
  linkage to the SEER cancer registries in California and Hawaii."
