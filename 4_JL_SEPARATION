Objective: We have files with Japanese and Latino cohort combined. By using "less -S" on said file (3 of them which are phenotype files), there is a column which indicates J or L. 
    Create bed, bim, fam files (for each ethnicity) and separate each cohort by ethnicity. 
    Note: Keep is command used for people. 
   
Researche either awk, sed, or grep commands for possible solution (probably awk??)
