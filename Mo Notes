Can merge the AA bed/bim/fam files (MERGING STEP)
"pwd" to print working directory and find path to merge files
    In this case " /home/wheelerlab1/Data/dbGaP_Prostate_prj_13579"
mohammed@wheelerlab1:/home/wheelerlab1/Data/dbGaP_Prostate_prj_13579$ nano prostate_list
    "nano" is a text editor that also creates the file "prostate_list" that you can edit the text inside of
    This is where you can do /path/c2.bed /path/c2.bim /path/c2.fam all the way to c5
    You DO NOT start with the first file (c1) because it is used as the reference base, so you continue past that one onto the remainder of files, leaving spaces between the paths
    Then control X to exit and save the data in your OWN directory
    It will not just let you save to global directory or just anywhere because of safety reasons.

    So the prostate_list has been made and presence checked
    Now you can input the command to merge the files you want merged.

    IMPORTANT MERGING STEP
    ADD NOTES HERE ABOUT WHAT EACH COMMAND DOES
    bfile was used because it is binary files (bed, bim, fam)
    This takes a few seconds but the targeted files (bed, bim, fam) files were succesfully merged into 1 file

    NOTE: To remove a file, you can always list the contents of directory with "ls" and then remove intended file with "rm"
 
What does this do? Lists contents of said files. However, what is difference between log and hh file and why????

    mohammed@wheelerlab1:~$ less -S GENEVA_MEC_ProstateCancer_AA_all.log 
    mohammed@wheelerlab1:~$ less GENEVA_MEC_ProstateCancer_AA_all.hh 
 
Input command "wc -l GENEVA_MEC_ProstateCancer_AA_all.fam”
4874 GENEVA_MEC_ProstateCancer_AA_all.fam
    This will tell you how many lines of data there are in a particular file or type of files
    In this case, there are around 4900 AA ppl from which we have data for
 
mohammed@wheelerlab1:~$ cd /home/wheelerlab1/Data/dbGaP_Prostate_prj_13579/
mohammed@wheelerlab1:/home/wheelerlab1/Data/dbGaP_Prostate_prj_13579$ wc GENEVA_MEC_ProstateCancer_AA_FORWARD_subject_level_c*.fam
    By doing the “*” command afterwards, you can list the total contents (people, SNPs, etc.)
